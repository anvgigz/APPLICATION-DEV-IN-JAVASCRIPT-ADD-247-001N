4. Understanding Side Effects
Side effects are changes that occur outside the function during its execution. They make functions impure and harder to reason about.

4.1 Common Side Effects in JavaScript
Modifying global variables: window.userCount = 5;
Changing function arguments: array.push(item);
Console output: console.log("Hello");
DOM manipulation: document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = "New Title";
API calls: fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
File system operations: fs.writeFile("file.txt", "content");
Random numbers: Math.random();
Date/time functions: new Date();
